Testing
======

### Testing User Stories from User Experience
- First Time Visitor Goals
    * As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
        + At the top of every site is a logo with a link to the index page and a clean and 
        easily readable navigation bar with good describes link of the pages of the website.

    * As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of this site.
        + Underneath the navigation is a Hero Image, to see on it is the Blogger and 
        in the background one of the favourite places of the Blogger, 
        directly followed by an informative About section.

    * As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily find on the site interesting stories and information.
        + The new visitor will notice after the About section a simple nice Overview section, 
        four images with a linked title to the attendant Blog pages, 
        about all the countries of which currently a Blog site with posts is available.      

    * As a First Time Visitor, I would like to be able to see images of places and activities.
        + On all pages, besides the Contact site, are nicely placed images of the places and 
        the activities from these countries.

    * As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate the Bloggers social media links to see all the other activities of the Blogger.
        + At the bottom of every page is a footer section with social icons, 
        which are linked to the social media pages and email address of the Blogger. 
        So the users have the possibility to get in touch with the Blogger.   

- Returning and Frequent User Goals

    * As a Returning and Frequent User, I would like to be able to get in contact with the blogger for questions about the Blog and the Blogger.
        + The user can get with the contact form on the contact page in touch with the Blogger 
        or over the social icons in the footer section, 
        which are at all pages at the bottom.

    * As a Returning and Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new Blog posts.  
        + There is at the moment no feature, which shows new Blog posts, 
        which will be a future feature.

    * As a Returning and Frequent User, I want to sign up to a Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website.
        + This is also not a requested feature of the Blogger, 
        but it would be a good feature for the future, 
        if the Blogger plans to make regular Blog posts.

### Testing Tools
- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpuksrevolution.github.io%2Fmilestone-project-1%2F)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpuksrevolution.github.io%2Fmilestone-project-1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=de)
- [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
- [Google Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

### Further Testing
I used Developer Tools to test the website through different browsers and screen sizes.<br>
I used Google Chrome Lighthouse, W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to run tests.<br>
I optimized the SEO with a meta description, I secured links with rel="noopener" and 
I changed the html lang="en" on all German pages to html lang="de". <br>
I tested all links numerous times for their correctly functionality.<br>
Friends tested the site on their devices, review the content of the website and the documentation 
to point out any bugs, issues or mistakes.<br>
I also did some recommended style changes of my Mentor for the website.

### Known Bugs
- I noticed that the hero images took too much space of the height of the screen on all devices, so I changed that.
- I also changed the footer height and the sizes of the social media icons, so that they fit on all size screens in one line and the text has also get better presented.
- I noticed some spelling mistakes which I have fixed.

Deployment
======

### Resporitory on GitHub
- I log into my GitHub account and get to "Your repositories"
- I used the my-full-temlate Repository I got from the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) to created a public milestone-project-1 Repository with the button "use this Template".

### Workspace on Gitpod
- I used the green "Gitpod" button to open the milestone-project-1 Repository in the workspace Gitpod.
- I pinned first the workspace milestone-project-1 on the dashbord.
- Then I opened the workspace and created the required folders, files and code for the website and added all needed images.
- I used regular the git commands to commit and save the work on Gitpod.

### Back to GitHub
- I saved the work I did on Gitpod at the end of every day with the help of the git push command, which pushes (saves) everything back on GitHub.

### Deploy the projet to GitHub Pages
- I located at the top of the Repository the "Settings" Button on the menu.
- I had to scroll down the Settings page untilthe "GitHub Pages" Section.
- I clicked the dropdonwn called "None" under "Source" and select "Master Branch".
- I clicked on the "Save" button and the page automatically refreshed.
- I had to scroll down again to the "GitHub Pages" Section to get the published site link for my project.
